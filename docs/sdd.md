# Software Design Document (SDD) - `svc-atc` 

## :telescope: Overview

This document details the software implementation of `svc-atc`.

This service is an automated air traffic control service responsible for maintaining safe separation of VTOL aircraft.

## :gear: Logic

### Initialization

At initialization this service creates two servers on separate threads: a GRPC server and a REST server.

The REST server expects the following environment variables to be set:
- `DOCKER_PORT_REST` (default: `8000`)

The GRPC server expects the following environment variables to be set:
- `DOCKER_PORT_GRPC` (default: `50051`)

### Loop

As a REST and GRPC server, this service awaits requests and executes handlers.

Some handlers **require** the following environment variables to be set:
- `STORAGE_HOST_GRPC`
- `STORAGE_PORT_GRPC`

This information allows this service to connect to other microservices to obtain information requested by the client.

For detailed sequence diagrams regarding request handlers, see [Interface Handlers](#speech_balloon-interface-handlers).

### Cleanup

No cleanup behavior.

### `ack`

Aircraft will confirm that they've received a flight plan.

        service-->>scheduler:: Cancel Flight
    end
```

## Common Actions

Attempt aircraft reroute

    alt Tier 2
        service-->>scheduler: Cancel flight
    end
    alt Tier 3
